# finance_lab
This application implements the Chernoff Approximation Method for solving second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), specifically applied to option pricing in quantitative finance. The implementation is based on Theorem 6 from Remizov (2025), using a translation-based approach to approximate the evolution operator e^(tL).
